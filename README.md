# Darkstart
### (Work in progress)
An  ethereum-blockchain based implementation of kickstart which fixes the issue of the funding being misused under some personal agenda.

## Getting Started
Although all dependencies are installed in the node-modules folder itself but "Metmask" is required in order to run the project.

Metamask is a browser extension which allows access to your ethereum wallet. We will be using the Rinkeby Test Network for this project. Before actually running it, you need ether in your acccounts which you require to run the project on.
